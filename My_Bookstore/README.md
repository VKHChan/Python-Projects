My_Bookstore is a desktop app that allows the user to maintain a database of book records.

Each book record contains the following information on the book:

Through the app, the user can perform the following tasks:
  1. View all the record in the database
  2. Search for a record given the title or author or year or isbn
  3. Add a new record
  4. Update an existing record
  5. Delete an existing record

The graphical user interface is created using tkiner, and the database is created using sqlite3.
